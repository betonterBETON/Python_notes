def is a statement
    - not merely a declaration!
    - when a module is imported or run, top-level functions are defined

python module
    - any .py file constitutes a module
    - they can be written for:
        - convenient execution (from cli) => scripts
        - convenient import (from other modules) => module
        - both (when using the if __name__ == __main__ idiom) --> USE THIS

python script
    - designed to be run from shell, like win batch or unix shell scripts

python program
    - perhaps consists of many modules


when testing in the REPL:

IMPORTING
    - style 1
        from words import (fetch_words, print_words)
        # the parentheses are optional, but
        # that way, we can have the imports broken into many lines!

        print_words(fetch_words())
        # we imported those two functions independently, so you may as well
        # run print_words(['any', 'word', 'list']) and it will work too
        # or any iterables:
    - style 2
        from words import *
        # this is not recommended, b/c the code is beyond your control (don't know
        # what functions you may import (potential namespace clashes!!)
