def is a statement
    - not merely a declaration!
    - when a module is imported or run, top-level functions are defined

python module
    - any .py file constitutes a module
    - they can be written for:
        - convenient execution (from cli) => scripts
        - convenient import (from other modules) => module
        - both (when using the if __name__ == __main__ idiom) --> USE THIS

python script
    - designed to be run from shell, like win batch or unix shell scripts

python program
    - perhaps consists of many modules
