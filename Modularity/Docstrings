docstrings
    - literal strings, which document functions, modules, and classes
    - occur as the first statement within a named block, e.g. function or module
    - use triple quoted strings even for single line docstrings, b/c they can be
      easily expanded
    - official convention is PEP 257
    - Sphinx - tool to create HTML from python docstrings
    - Google python styleguide - use it

comments:
    - ideally, the code should be clear enough without ancillary explanation
    - sometimes it is necessary to explain WHY code is written as it is

windows:
    - cmd:
      words.py <URL> --> Pylauncher parses the shebang if given and runs words.py
      using the right python version (PyLauncher: PEP 397)
    - PowerShell:
      .\words.py <url>

to read docstrings:
    - import words
      help(words)
    - from words import *
      help(function_name)
