Scopes
    - type declarations are unnecessary in Python
    - variables are untyped name bindings to objects
    - names can be rebound (reassigned) as often as necessary to objects of any type
    - where are name bindings stored? check scopes and scoping rules in Python

Types of scope in Python
    - there are 4 types of scope in Python arranged in a hierarchy
    - each scope is a context, in which names are stored
    - from narrowest to broadest, the scopes are:
        LOCAL       inside the current function
        ENCLOSING   inside enclosing funcions
        GLOBAL      at the top level of the module
        BUILT-IN    in the special builtins module
    - scopes comprise the LEGB rule: names are looked up in the narrowest relevant context
    - scopes in Python do not correspond to source code blocks (as demarcated by indentation)
        (for-loops and the like do not introduce new nested scopes)

Rebinding global names:
    - ocasionally we need to rebind a global name (one that is defined at module scope) from within a funciton
