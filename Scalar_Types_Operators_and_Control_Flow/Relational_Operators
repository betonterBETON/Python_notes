Relational operators
    - are used for comparing objects

    == value equality/equivalence
    != value inequality/inequivalence

    rich comparison operators:
    <  less than
    >  greater than
    <= less than or equal
    >= greater than or equal

Equality/inequality
    - integer:
        >>> g = 20
        >>> g == 20
        True
        >>> g == 13
        False
        >>> g != 20
        False
        >>> g != 13
        True

The same applies to rich comparison operators.
