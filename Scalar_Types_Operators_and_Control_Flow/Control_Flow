Conditional statements
    - allow us to branch execution based on the value of an expression

If-statement:
    - format:
        if <expression>:
            <block>
    - examples:
        >>> if True:
            print("It's true!")


        It's true!
        >>> if False:
            print("It's true!")


        >>>
    - the expression in the if-statement will be converted to a bool,
      so it doesn't matter if we put a constructor there (explicitly constructing a bool)
      or e.g. bare string (those are 100% equivalent, therefore explicit conversion
      to bool is rarely used in Python):
        >>> if bool("eggs"):
            print("Yes please!")


        Yes please!
        >>> if "eggs":
            print("Yes please!")


        Yes please!
    - the if-statement supports the optional "else" clause:
        >>> h = 42
        >>> if h >50:
            print("Greater than 50")
        else:
            print("50 or smaller")


        50 or smaller
    - flat is better than nested, therefore do not use nested else clauses,
      instead, use "elif" clause, with an optional "else" at the end
